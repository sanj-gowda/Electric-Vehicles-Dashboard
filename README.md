# Electric-Vehicles-Dashboard

This repository contains the Tableau dashboard I created based on insights learned from a tutorial video. The dashboard provides an interactive visualization of Electric Vehicles Data. The goal of this project was to enhance my skills in data visualization and storytelling using Tableau.

Key Features
Interactive Filters: Users can filter the data by CAFV Eligibilty, EV Type, State or Model.
Visualizations Used: The dashboard includes line chart, bar chart, area map, donut chart etc.

Through this project, I learned the following:
Creating Visualizations in Tableau: Learned how to create and customize different types of charts, maps, and other visual elements.
Dashboard Design: Developed skills in arranging visualizations and designing a cohesive, user-friendly dashboard layout.
Interactive Features: Added filters, tooltips, and other interactive features to enhance user experience.

This project was inspired by a Tableau tutorial video that guided me through the process of building this dashboard.
